//After reading Hidden Features and Dark Corners of C++ / STL on comp.lang.c++.moderated, I was completely surprised that the following snippet compiled and worked in both Visual Studio 2008 and G++ 4.4.I would assume this is also valid C since it works in GCC as well.

//Here's the code:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    //while (x--> 0) // x goes to 0
    //{
    //    printf("%d ", x);
    //}
    while ( x--\
                \
                 \
                  \
                   > 0)
        printf("%d ", x);
}
